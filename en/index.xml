&lt;p>This week, my income broke through a thousand yuan, achieving a milestone goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="this-weeks-self-help-actions">This Week&amp;rsquo;s Self-Help Actions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first four days of this week were busy.&lt;br>
I had to wear multiple hats - salesperson, customer service, after-sales support, and writer, doing everything myself.&lt;br>
I won&amp;rsquo;t elaborate much on computer skills as they&amp;rsquo;re my bread and butter.&lt;br>
Moreover, I found that my jack-of-all-trades technical skills are particularly suitable for small jobs that professionals might overlook.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being needed gives a sense of value.&lt;br>
On my busiest day, I communicated with more than ten clients while handling four tasks simultaneously.&lt;br>
Although the money earned isn&amp;rsquo;t much, it&amp;rsquo;s at least a validation of my personal labor.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lets-talk-about-failed-cases">Let&amp;rsquo;s Talk About Failed Cases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first one was a remote printing job.&lt;br>
The client was very nice to me, first giving me a small task with a tip, then assigning me this job.&lt;br>
As luck would have it, I had two unfinished projects at the time.&lt;br>
After pondering for two hours, I realized remote printing wasn&amp;rsquo;t that simple, and with other ongoing projects, I had to refund the payment.&lt;br>
It was quite awkward, as it consumed the trust placed in me.&lt;br>
Well, accepting payment is a guarantee of trust - if you don&amp;rsquo;t have time or confidence, don&amp;rsquo;t take the money carelessly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second case was developing a webpage modification plugin.&lt;br>
The client described it simply - just changing 1 to 2 in a table on a webpage, so I quoted a low price.&lt;br>
Later, I discovered it was a foreign government website, and just the key login took over an hour, with modifications being not so straightforward.&lt;br>
I had to refund again.&lt;br>
This client was quite cunning, describing an apparently easy task that was actually much more complex.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for successful cases, I won&amp;rsquo;t say much, but here&amp;rsquo;s one touching feedback:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;What I couldn&amp;rsquo;t solve in a week, you fixed in an hour. I&amp;rsquo;ll come directly to you next time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="phase-summary">Phase Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In February, after the Spring Festival, I reassessed my situation.&lt;br>
I clarified my direction: focusing on freelancing to solve survival needs first,&lt;br>
with content writing and personal projects as my second trajectory for personal development.&lt;br>
Although this choice remains high-risk, it&amp;rsquo;s shaped by past experiences - there&amp;rsquo;s no good or bad about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking at the results from the past three weeks, this year&amp;rsquo;s short-term self-help plan seems feasible.&lt;br>
As long as freelancing can solve survival needs, I don&amp;rsquo;t need to look for a job for now.&lt;br>
I&amp;rsquo;ve now repositioned myself as: &lt;strong>Your Personal Technical Handyman.&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
In other words, I&amp;rsquo;m like a temporary computer technology plumber.&lt;br>
Can&amp;rsquo;t fix a bug? I&amp;rsquo;ll repair it; Can&amp;rsquo;t set up development environment? I&amp;rsquo;ll help remotely;&lt;br>
Don&amp;rsquo;t want to handle legacy projects? No problem, let me do it; Need a small application? I can make it in three days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>For larger projects, unless particularly interesting, I probably won&amp;rsquo;t consider them for now.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Some reflections:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Efficient communication, no prolonged battles. Directly reject grey industry requests. End conversations early with those seeking cheap labor. No need to continue talking if requirements and budget aren&amp;rsquo;t clear within 10 messages.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Organize and master communication skills. Friends say I&amp;rsquo;m too rigid - yes, you can see it in my writing style, my EQ is quite low. But in sales and customer service, attitude and awareness are needed, so I&amp;rsquo;ll have to let AI teach me how to communicate with clients.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improve pricing skills. This can only come from experience. Some small jobs are simple but take 3-4 hours, making low prices very unprofitable. Some issues could be resolved earlier through prior communication.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;h2 id="this-weeks-self-help-actions">This Week&amp;rsquo;s Self-Help Actions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Last weekend, I took on a writing job for an academic paper about machine learning.&lt;br>
I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about machine learning, but I can write some Python.&lt;br>
With AI assistance available, I boldly accepted the project.&lt;br>
Looking back now, it was a bit presumptuous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I spent four full days coding. During the first two days with little progress, I almost gave up.&lt;br>
On the third day, things started moving forward, but hardware limitations and AI debugging loops became challenging.&lt;br>
The main issue was my lack of understanding. When asking AI for explanations, I could read every word but couldn&amp;rsquo;t grasp why things were done certain ways.&lt;br>
I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to study the fundamentals, so I had to push through with countless new AI conversations and experiments.&lt;br>
The most troublesome part was the loss of context - I had to keep summarizing our previous progress for the AI.&lt;br>
Nevertheless, I managed to achieve the experimental objectives, with only one day left before the client&amp;rsquo;s deadline.&lt;br>
On the final day, I hurriedly produced a paper of nearly 20,000 words, of course, with AI assistance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I submitted the work, I felt completely drained of energy for the entire week.&lt;br>
This was my first time writing an academic paper and my first time coding for machine learning.&lt;br>
This job wasn&amp;rsquo;t just stepping out of my comfort zone - it was like rolling in uncomfortable darkness.&lt;br>
Although I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely satisfied with the quality of the paper and code, at least I delivered something to the client.&lt;br>
This money wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy to earn!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In retrospect, for a professional, this would have been a two-day job.&lt;br>
One day for coding, one day for writing - equivalent to 500 per day, making it somewhat feasible.&lt;br>
My main challenge was being completely unfamiliar with machine learning, which requires time to learn.&lt;br>
I estimate it would take two weeks to grasp the basic knowledge.&lt;br>
But I&amp;rsquo;m unsure what else I could do with machine learning knowledge besides writing papers.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Have you had experience in tutoring academic paper writing?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do you think machine learning is worth investing time to learn?&lt;/li>

I have a middle school education, self-taught programming, and started my career in Shenzhen.&lt;br>
Later, I ran a youth hostel in Lijiang for 7 years, which closed due to the pandemic and other reasons.&lt;br>
Not wanting to return to big cities, I did remote work for over a year.&lt;br>
Two years ago, I went traveling with my girlfriend, and my programming work was interrupted again.&lt;br>
During the travels, I helped my girlfriend with social media accounts, shooting videos, and writing content.&lt;br>
Last year showed some improvement, but the income wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough to cover even half of one person&amp;rsquo;s expenses.&lt;br>
The dream of being financially supported by content creation fell through.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year, to solve survival problems, I must make some changes.&lt;br>
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with this weekly journal, recording my self-rescue actions from the past week.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-save-myself">How to Save Myself&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Last year, I briefly tried the independent development path, creating a reader application called EvoReader.&lt;br>
But after launch, there was little feedback, and many features weren&amp;rsquo;t completed, so I paused the project.&lt;br>
Since I hadn&amp;rsquo;t figured out how to promote or monetize it, continuing development might only increase sunk costs.&lt;br>
I lacked confidence in this project.&lt;br>
Then I started learning and understanding how other independent developers do it, how they make money.&lt;br>
The reality is much harder than I imagined, with most independent developers&amp;rsquo; works disappearing in the vast internet ocean.&lt;br>
Even for the few that stand out, monetization is extremely difficult.&lt;br>
Succeeding in this path requires exceptionally high comprehensive abilities, and it&amp;rsquo;s time-consuming with uncertain results.&lt;br>
I urgently need to make money now, so this path can only be a side project in my spare time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ruling-out-big-city-job-search">Ruling Out Big City Job Search&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Having lived in rural Yunnan for many years, I&amp;rsquo;m too used to freedom and can&amp;rsquo;t return to big cities.&lt;br>
With my resume, job hunting would be extremely challenging.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="finding-remote-work">Finding Remote Work&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Usually, only small startup teams might need a versatile programmer like me.&lt;br>
This is relatively suitable but requires the right opportunity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="freelancing">Freelancing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Last year, I took some small projects on a platform, which proved to be a viable path.&lt;br>
However, there were too few projects with low rates.&lt;br>
I hadn&amp;rsquo;t accumulated enough experience, having had many choices before, I didn&amp;rsquo;t put much effort into freelancing.&lt;br>
I used to avoid projects I wasn&amp;rsquo;t interested in, but now I have to change my mindset.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Freelancing provides simple and direct feedback - each project means income.&lt;br>
With AI support, efficiency has greatly improved.&lt;br>
This is my main path for short-term self-rescue.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="content-writing">Content Writing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a personal website for a long time, which helped me find jobs and meet new friends.&lt;br>
But, well, the output was too little, update frequency too low, mainly because I was too lazy.&lt;br>
This path serves freelancing in the short term and potential personal works in the long term.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="writing-more-utility-applications">Writing More Utility Applications&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve now mastered an AI development process for personal use.&lt;br>
Development efficiency skyrockets as long as I have ideas.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="this-weeks-accomplishments">This Week&amp;rsquo;s Accomplishments&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Added Google Ads to my personal website. Well, although I know the revenue won&amp;rsquo;t be much, in the current situation, I have to try every direction;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Opened a WeChat Official Account - Cognitive Leap Plan;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Updated WeChat Official Account and Xiaohongshu, I must take this step, though I feel I&amp;rsquo;m a hundred steps behind others;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Compiled a list of remote work websites;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Joined 3 freelancing groups (still late to realize this);&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="this-weeks-income">This Week&amp;rsquo;s Income&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Completed 1 small project + 98 yuan;&lt;/li>

It was fast, had plenty of extensions, and made web debugging convenient - meeting all my needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, one day, Chrome suddenly changed its UI style, making it uncomfortable to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main issue was the change in the right-click menu, where menu options had larger spacing and required scrolling when there were too many options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initially, I could revert to the old UI style through &lt;code>chrome://flags/&lt;/code>, but later that option was completely removed.&lt;br>
While searching online for new solutions, I came across someone mentioning Vivaldi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I decided to give it a try.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="Vivaldi Browser" src="https://www.xianmin.org/post/2025/why-choose-vivaldi-browser-vs-chrome/vivaldi.jpg" title="Vivaldi Browser Interface">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Switching to Vivaldi wasn&amp;rsquo;t difficult at all since it&amp;rsquo;s also a Chromium-based browser that can directly install extensions from the Chrome Web Store.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I migrated my bookmarks, installed my frequently used extensions, and most of my needs were met.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Vivaldi&amp;rsquo;s right-click menu can be switched back to the old style, which was my initial motivation for using it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vivaldi adds many extra features on top of Chromium.&lt;br>
I didn&amp;rsquo;t use them much at first, but later discovered that some features were quite useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are several features I use most frequently:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sidebar Tab Management.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>When you have many tabs open, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see their titles or find the tab you want to switch to.&lt;br>
The sidebar window manager makes it convenient.&lt;br>
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to switch between tabs and perform operations like deletion and moving tabs.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Multi-page Tiling.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Sometimes you want to display two tabs in one window simultaneously, eliminating the need to switch back and forth.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Image Loading Toggle.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Some content-heavy websites have too many images when I only need to read the text.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Full Webpage Screenshot.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The built-in webpage screenshot tool is convenient to operate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although some Chrome extensions can achieve the above functions, Vivaldi integrates them into the browser, providing a smoother experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for Vivaldi&amp;rsquo;s other features like the built-in email client and RSS reader, I don&amp;rsquo;t use them, so I won&amp;rsquo;t comment on those.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Copy Unblocker - A Userscript to Remove Website Copy Restrictions</title><link>https://www.xianmin.org/en/post/2025/userscript-copy-unblocker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 13:36:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.xianmin.org/en/post/2025/userscript-copy-unblocker/</guid><description>&lt;p>Some websites prevent text copying.

To publish a new article, I only need to edit the Markdown file and upload it to Github, where GitHub Actions automatically generates the webpage for me.&lt;br>
The entire process is so simple that I can update blog posts even from my phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the number of blog posts increased, managing Markdown files became a challenge.&lt;br>
Previously, without good organizational habits, I placed all files directly in the &lt;code>post/&lt;/code> directory.&lt;br>
Later, as files accumulated, I created subdirectories like &lt;code>post/2024/&lt;/code> within the &lt;code>post/&lt;/code> directory.&lt;br>
The URL of a blog post is related to its file location. For example, a blog post at &lt;code>post/2024/example.md&lt;/code> would have the URL &lt;code>/post/2024/example/&lt;/code>.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>To avoid changing the URLs of published posts&lt;/strong>, I left the old Markdown files in their original locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="my blog old post structure" src="https://www.xianmin.org/image/post/2024/hugo-multilingual-blog-structure.png">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="multilingual-sites">Multilingual Sites&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Hugo has supported multilingual sites for many years, and I had considered creating an English version of my site, but translation was always an issue.&lt;br>
With the advancement of AI in recent years, translation quality has improved significantly.&lt;br>
Recently, I had the idea to create a multilingual site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Hugo, for multilingual sites, if you want a blog post to have multiple language versions, you typically need to create corresponding language versions of the md file.&lt;br>
For example, the English version of &lt;code>blog.md&lt;/code> would be &lt;code>blog.en.md&lt;/code>, and other languages follow the same pattern.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without a proper organization scheme, as time goes by, the number of files in the &lt;code>post/&lt;/code> directory would keep increasing, making it increasingly difficult to manage.&lt;br>
Additionally, modifying blog post URLs would become more complicated in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to address &lt;strong>how to organize files in the post/ directory&lt;/strong> early on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="need-for-a-proper-organization-scheme">Need for a Proper Organization Scheme&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Based on my past experience, creating a new folder for each year like &lt;code>post/2022/&lt;/code>, &lt;code>post/2023/&lt;/code>, &lt;code>post/2024/&lt;/code>, etc., is generally sufficient for my needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For multilingual sites, placing all &lt;code>blog.md&lt;/code> and &lt;code>blog.language.md&lt;/code> files in one folder isn&amp;rsquo;t ideal for management.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s better to keep all language versions of the same blog post in one folder, such as &lt;code>post/2024/blog/blog.md&lt;/code>, &lt;code>post/2024/blog/blog.language.md&lt;/code>, etc. However, this would result in URLs like &lt;code>/post/2024/blog/blog&lt;/code>, which is redundant. To address this, Hugo provides a &lt;code>slug&lt;/code> parameter that can modify the final part of the URL path.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, &lt;strong>to facilitate sorting, I add dates to the beginning of folder names&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, this article&amp;rsquo;s directory structure looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight-container">
&lt;button class="copy-code-btn outline">Copy&lt;/button>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>post

&lt;p>The &lt;code>Front Matter&lt;/code> structure of this article looks like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="organizing-old-markdown-files">Organizing Old Markdown Files&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With a proper organization scheme in place, we should reorganize existing files and place them in appropriate locations.&lt;br>
It&amp;rsquo;s particularly important to &lt;strong>avoid URL changes&lt;/strong>. Hugo provides a &lt;code>url&lt;/code> parameter that can set URLs to fixed values.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s my process:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 1: Delete the &lt;code>public/&lt;/code> directory, generate a new &lt;code>public/&lt;/code> based on existing blog posts, and rename it to &lt;code>public_old/&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 2: Transfer files one by one, adding the original &lt;code>url&lt;/code> address to transferred files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 3: After completing the transfer, regenerate the &lt;code>public/&lt;/code> directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 4: Compare &lt;code>public/sitemap.xml&lt;/code> and &lt;code>public_old/sitemap.xml&lt;/code> to check if URLs are consistent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 5: Use &lt;code>Beyond Compare&lt;/code> to check if &lt;code>public/&lt;/code> and &lt;code>public_old/&lt;/code> are consistent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When manually modifying URLs, also pay attention to URL case sensitivity.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Using &lt;a href="https://picocss.com/">Pico CSS&lt;/a> as the color scheme, with switchable theme colors and dark/light mode support.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Custom homepage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added STYLE SETTINGS, located in /assets/sass/_settings.scss&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deprecated Category page, merged into Archive page.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Since there are many modifications, some areas are still not perfect. Thank you for your understanding!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="customize-your-homepage">Customize Your Homepage&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The original homepage was a paginated article list, which could be somewhat monotonous. Now you can have a more personalized homepage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Copy &lt;code>/exampleSite/content/_index.md&lt;/code> to your website&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>/content/_index.md&lt;/code> and modify the parameters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For multilingual sites, create similar &lt;code>_index.language.md&lt;/code> files, such as &lt;code>_index.zh-cn.md&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="personalize-your-website-through-style-settings">Personalize Your Website Through STYLE SETTINGS&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Copy &lt;code>/assets/sass/_settings.scss&lt;/code> and &lt;code>/assets/sass/_custom.scss&lt;/code> to your website&amp;rsquo;s root directory (Note: path names and file names must match).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Modify variables in &lt;code>_settings.scss&lt;/code> and add custom styles in &lt;code>/assets/sass/_custom.scss&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="upgrading-from-old-version-to-v3">Upgrading from Old Version to v3&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Due to the new version using the latest Sass language features, Dart Sass needs to be installed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Installation guide can be found in the official documentation: &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/transpile-sass-to-css/#dart-sass">https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/transpile-sass-to-css/#dart-sass&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re using CI/CD automation tools, remember to install Dart Sass as well: &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/transpile-sass-to-css/#installing-in-a-production-environment">https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/transpile-sass-to-css/#installing-in-a-production-environment&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: You might encounter some compatibility issues after upgrading. If you face any difficulties, feel free to open an issue.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>No &lt;code>node_modules&lt;/code>, fewer dependencies mean easier maintenance&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Encouraging users to modify the theme according to their preferences for a more personalized website&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reading experience is always the top priority&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deploy once, focus on writing, no more tinkering&lt;/li>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this website theme for seven years. Except for frequent changes in the first year, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been modified much since then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve always believed that for personal blogs, the written content is the most important, and as for the website style, it just needs to be acceptable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This major revision was a sudden inspiration to completely change the color scheme and upgrade the Hugo version while at it.&lt;/p>

Meanwhile, the &lt;code>CapsLock&lt;/code> key, which is rarely used, occupies a prime location on the keyboard. Over my years of computer usage, swapping the positions of &lt;code>Ctrl&lt;/code> and &lt;code>CapsLock&lt;/code> keys has significantly improved my comfort and efficiency when using keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how to swap these two keys using PowerShell commands (must be run as administrator):&lt;/p>
